The [Citizen Cyberscience Summit](http://cybersciencesummit.org/) bringing together an interdisciplinary selection of researchers, hackers and citizen to discuss and share ideas on all things related to citizen science will be held in London the next three days. 

Together with [Patrick Rickles](https://twitter.com/mapperpat) I will be giving a talk followed presenting past present and future developments of Community Maps followed by a short workshop to discuss our ides with you and to find out what you expect from next generation of participatory mapping platforms.
