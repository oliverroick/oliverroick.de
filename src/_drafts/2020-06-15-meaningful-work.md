At last year's company summer party, one of the higher-ups took me aside and asked, What is your passion, Oliver? Three beers in, I mumbled something about building great products and something about maps and helping people understand data or so.

I had never really thought about it.

Earlier this year, I enrolled in a leadership course, which covers philosophical and scientific background to today's leadership best practices. I learned about concepts like [Eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) and how dedicating time to other's flourishing leads to self-actualisation and happiness. And I was lucky to meet a mentor who asks the right questions and helped me work through some of this thinking. 

What I found is that I'm not passionate (maybe not even that interested) in building products. I want to do work that does not optimise for conversion and revenue. [...]

This definition of meaning is personal. It does not mean that anyone who does not want to dedicate their work to a charity isn't doing meaningful work. Some people want to build the most stable and scalable systems in the world, some get a kick out of designing and building beautiful APIs and others want to make teams more efficient. And some like to earn a lot of money. People are driven by different things.

I recently changed jobs. I left the fin-tech world after about a year to join [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/). I help build their case-management system, which is used in offices around the UK to get citizens access to services and information they need. And the data we gather is used to identify issues in UK policies and influence politics. I like that idea.
