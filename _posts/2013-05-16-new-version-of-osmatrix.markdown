A new interation of [OSMatrix](http://osmatrix.uni-hd.de/) has been released today. The client application has been re-designed and implemented from ground-up leveraging latest technologies (HTML5 and CSS3) and open-source frameworks ([Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and [D3](http://d3js.org/)). We further rebuilt server-side components using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and its awesome ecosystem of extensions for data processing and [Mapnik](http://mapnik.org/) for map rendering purposes. For a detailed description of new features read my post on [GIScience Blog](http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2013/05/16/new-version-of-osmatrix/).
